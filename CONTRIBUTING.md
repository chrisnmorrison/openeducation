# Contributing to Open Ed

:tada: Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Open Ed(ucation). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in an issue and pull request.

Open Ed is a very straightforward project, so we plan on keeping our contributing guidelines simple. There are two types of contributions: no-code submissions, and code submissions. Both are very important to us!

## Code of Conduct

## I Have a Quick Question / Concern

For quick questions/concerns, there are two preferred options:

- Our subreddit: [Click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/openeducation/)
- Email us: [opendotone@gmail.com](mailto:opendotone@gmail.com)

## Types of Contributions

Please note that for both types of contributions, [Git and Github](https://github.com/opendotone/openeducation) is the primary submission type. For code contributions, we only accept Github pull requests. For non-code contributions, we are open to accepting other forms of contributions, such as documents sent to [our email](mailto:opendotone@gmail.com). We'll talk more about that in the following section.

If you aren't familiar with Git or Github, it's (fairly) easy to learn! Our Git workout is very simple, so you really only need to know: common Git commands, general Github workflow, issues, and pull requests. [This video covers the basics of how to contribute to an open source project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbqSvJs-6W4), and [this video goes more depth into Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk). We highly recommend both, so that you feel comfortable contributing!

### No-Code Contributions

No-code contributions include:

- New Article submissions
- Editing articles (adding content, grammar fixes, broken links, etc.)
- Recommendations and discussions on our page content, such as our [About Us](https://openeducation.one/about) page.

If you would like to contribute, please open an issue on Github. If you aren't quite sure how to do this, take a look at some of the other issues to get an idea! No matter what, open the issue, and if it needs more info we'll let you know.

For no-code submissions, we also accept email submissions (for those who are less tech savvy, or who aren't interested in using Git). Just send us a PDF or Word document with the information we need, and one of the maintainers will review it!

[View our open issues here, or open an issue](https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/openeducation/issues). No-Code contributions include updates to `md` or `mdx` files, most of which are our articles. This requires knowledge of Markdown. If you don't know how to read/write Markdown, don't sweat it. We label it as "No-Code" because it's not really coding, and it's very easy to read and learn. [Here's a straightforward tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). No-Code contributions are labelled with the Github label `No-Code`, which you can view on Github [here](https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/openeducation/labels/No-Code).

If you are contributing a new article or if you would like to learn about our article structure, [head over to this page](https://opened.one/learn/meta/a-guide-to-our-article-structure). 

### Code Contributions

Open Ed's tech stack includes:

- HTML, CSS, JS
- React
- Styled Components
- SCSS
- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- Node.js

If you know any of these, you can contribute!

[View our open issues here, or open an issue](https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/openeducation/issues). Code contributions include updates to our coded pages or templates, and will use one or more of the technologies above. Code contributions are labelled with the Github label `Code`, which you can view on Github [here](https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/openeducation/labels/Code).

Types of Code contributions include

- Styling fixes or improvements
- Gatsby pipeline errors (e.g. incorrectly generated URLs)
- Gatsby performance improvements
- CSS improvements (speed or file structure)
- Building React components
- Improving existing React components
- and so much more!

We want to encourage a balance of creativity and site usability. We don't plan on implementing breaking changes often. Rather, we want to focus on improvements while only implementing new features that don't "break" the user experience, so to speak. If you have a cool idea, run it by us on our [Github issues page](https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/openeducation/issues) and we can explore it further. Code changes must be approved by the maintainers (and tested thoroughly) before being implemented on our live, production site.

**Note**: We know that unprompted code contributions may be difficult to think of, so when the contributors have a chance, they will create issues to report bugs, updates, fixes, etc. so that if you would like to make a code contribution, you have a starting point.
