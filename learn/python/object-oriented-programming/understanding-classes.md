# Classes (Theory)

A class is a foundational concept that enables the creation of objects with defined attributes and behaviors. Think of a class as a blueprint or a template that outlines the structure and capabilities an object should possess. This article delves into the essence of classes, shedding light on their role in constructing organized and efficient code.

:::warning Classes vs Objects
We'll look at objects soon. For now, try to keep this simple idea in mind:

A class is a blueprint, and an object is an actual thing created from this blueprint. You write a class once and create as many objects from it as you'd like.

## Defining the Class: A Blueprint for Objects

At its core, a class is a user-defined data type in programming. It serves as a blueprint for creating instances, also known as objects. Just as a blueprint guides the construction of a building, a class outlines the construction of objects by specifying their attributes and methods.

## Attributes: Characteristics That Define

Attributes, sometimes referred to as properties or fields, are the building blocks of a class. They represent the data or characteristics associated with an object. For example, if you're creating a class to represent a "Person," attributes might include "name," "age," and "gender." These attributes define the state of an object and hold its pertinent information.

## Methods: Actions to Take

Methods are functions defined within a class that define the actions or behaviors an object can perform. If attributes are the static aspects of an object, methods are the dynamic aspects. For instance, a "Person" class might have methods like "speak()" or "walk()" to encapsulate the person's abilities.

## Creating Objects from Classes

Once a class is defined, you can create multiple objects based on that class. Each object is an instance of the class, and it possesses the attributes and methods outlined in the class definition. Imagine a class called "Car" with attributes like "color" and "make," and methods like "start_engine()" â€“ creating an object from this class would give you a specific car with its own color, make, and the ability to start its engine.

## Class Structure: Organized and Modular

Classes provide a structured approach to programming by encapsulating (i.e. grouping together) related data and behaviors. This modular design encourages code organization and reusability. Instead of writing separate code for each individual object, you define the class once and then create objects as needed.
