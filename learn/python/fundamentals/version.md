# Which version do i use?

At the time of writing this Python series, we used 3.11.X to run and test our code. Specifically, 3.11.4.

The release version you must use for this course **must be Python 3 or above**, and any version of 3.X.X will work. Python 3 had several breaking changes compared to Python 2, and since version >=3 has been out for some time, there isn't really any reason to learn Python 2. In fact, version 2 was [sunsetted in 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).

The vast majority of Python tutorials nowadays use Python 3, however, every so often we come across old articles using Python 2.

The easiest way to get started is to simply download and install the latest version of Python 3. As a learner, the specific version you use is largely irrelevant. Focus on the syntax and the concepts, like data structures, instead.
