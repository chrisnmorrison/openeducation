# Let's Get Started!

This course on Beginner Java will be split into three parts:

**First**, we'll discuss core Java syntax. From variables to objects, you'll become comfortable reading and writing Java code.

**Second**, we'll discuss key Java libraries, and how to utilize pre-written Java code to the fullest

**Lastly**, we'll discuss the Java Collections Framework (JCF). The JCF contains pre-written data structures 

There are a few more advanced concepts that will be touched on briefly, but we'll save the more detailed explanations for other courses. These include:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Modern Java Syntax (i.e. Java 8 and beyond) 
- Design Patterns
- Database connections with JDBC
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) development

We highly recommend mastering the core Java syntax before tackling more advanced concepts! Becoming comfortable with a language's core syntax will save you a headache in the long run.
