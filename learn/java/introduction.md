# Let's Get Started!

This course on Beginner Java will be split into three parts:

**First**, we'll discuss core Java syntax. From variables to exception handling, you'll become comfortable reading and writing Java code.

**Then**, we'll discuss object-oriented programming (OOP): The theory of OOP, and what it looks like in Java code.

**Lastly**, we'll discuss the Java Collections Framework (JCF). The JCF contains pre-written data structures, so that you don't have to code data structures from scratch!

There are a few more advanced concepts that will be touched on briefly, but we won't be thoroughly covering them in this course. These include:
- Data Structures and Algorithms (we will only cover the Java Collections framework)
- Modern Java Syntax (i.e. Java 8 and beyond) 
- Design Patterns
- Database connections with JDBC
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) development

We highly recommend mastering the core Java syntax before tackling more advanced concepts! Becoming comfortable with a language's core syntax will save you a headache in the long run. Even if it feels like you're only writing "dummy programs" that have no real world uses, remember that the core syntax and OOP is still used in the real world, but with a few extra bells and whistles. It's important to understand the foundations before diving into more advanced topics.
