# Are Tech interviews just coding questions?

Coding is just one part of the job. Your potential employer wants to know that you can work well with others. Despite the stereotype that programmers lack people-skills, programming jobs involve a huge amount of teamwork and collaboration. Yes, your employer wants to know that you can work with others. Code can be learned much easier than social aptitude, so if you come across as someone who won't work well with others, your code aptitude won't matter. 

Preparing for soft skill questions in interviews involves identifying the key qualities and behaviors that the company may be looking for in a candidate. Here are some tips to help you prepare for soft skill questions:

1. Research the company culture: Look for information about the company culture on their website, social media, or employee review sites. This can give you a sense of what qualities and values the company may prioritize.
2. Identify the soft skills required for the job: Read the job description carefully and identify the soft skills required for the position. For example, the job may require strong communication skills, teamwork, or adaptability.
3. Prepare stories and examples: Prepare stories and examples that showcase your soft skills. For example, if the job requires teamwork, prepare a story about a successful team project you worked on. **Always answer using the S.T.A.R. method**. Even if you think it's a cheesy way to prepare and rehearse answers, many HR interviewers specifically look for this type of answer.
4. Practice your answers: Practice your answers to common soft skill questions, such as "Tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult situation" or "How do you handle conflicts with coworkers?"
5. Be authentic: Be genuine and authentic in your answers. Interviewers can often tell if you are giving canned or insincere responses.
6. Ask questions: Ask thoughtful questions about the company culture and work environment. This can show that you are interested in the company and invested in finding the right fit.

Remember that soft skills are just as important as technical skills in many positions. Preparing for soft skill questions can help you demonstrate that you have the qualities and behaviors that the company is looking for in a candidate.
