# How do I learn programming without getting stuck in Tutorial Hell?

This question has an easy answer, and a slightly more intricate answer.

## Easy Answer

Beginners should closely follow tutorials, and focus on understanding the concepts behind programming, and Computer Science in general. After learning the basics, you should stop following tutorials and start writing your own code. Literally, anything on your own. This helps cement your programming knowledge.

Most ideal scenario - **learn a concept, then immediately create something with it**. For example, if you learn about the four pillars of object oriented programming, write some _original_ code to cement the concepts. Don't just copy a tutorial, but if you get stuck, googling is allowed and encouraged.

Remember - programming isn't about remembering code. It's about remembering concepts and understanding what code is capable of. Googling is 100% encouraged, as well as reading documentation when you are stuck. This is a great exercise in resourcefulness and research, and this is what everyone in industry does. A good programmer is **resourceful** more than anything.

## Long Answer

The above sounds easy, but it's not always so simple.

Tutorial Hell is a term used to describe the experience of being stuck in a never-ending cycle of tutorials without actually making any real progress. It's a phenomenon that can occur when learners become overly reliant on tutorials or online courses to learn new skills. Instead of taking the time to practice and apply the knowledge they've learned, they continue to seek out more tutorials in the hopes of finding the "perfect" one that will finally help them to make progress.

**Why does Tutorial Hell happen?**

There are a few reasons why Tutorial Hell can happen:

- Fear of Failure: Often, learners are afraid of making mistakes and failing. As a result, they may be hesitant to apply the knowledge they've learned in practice, fearing that they'll get something wrong.
- Lack of Confidence: In some cases, learners may lack confidence in their abilities, which can lead to a lack of motivation and a reluctance to try new things.
- Overwhelm: Sometimes, the sheer amount of information available can be overwhelming, making it difficult for learners to know where to start or how to proceed.

**Tips to Escape Tutorial Hell**

If you're stuck in Tutorial Hell, here are some tips that may help you escape:

- Set a Goal: Setting a specific goal for what you want to achieve can help you stay focused and motivated. Break down the goal into smaller, manageable steps, and work on each step one at a time.
- Practice, Practice, Practice: It's important to practice what you've learned in order to fully understand it. Start with small, simple projects and gradually work your way up to more complex ones.
- Collaborate with Others: Working with other learners or more experienced individuals in the field can be a great way to get feedback, learn new approaches, and stay motivated.
- Take Breaks: It's important to take breaks from learning and practicing to avoid burnout. Doing something unrelated to your field of study, like exercising or reading a book, can help you recharge and return to your work with fresh energy.
- Stop Relying on Tutorials: While tutorials can be helpful for learning new skills, it's important not to rely on them too heavily. Instead, try to apply what you've learned in your own projects and experiment with different approaches.

Remember, the key is to keep moving forward and to never give up on your goals.

Recognize what might be setting you back, and take the time to address it.

:::tip Be resourceful!
Complete beginners in technical fields often don't know what to google, or what to do next. This is okay, and it's part of the process. Every programmer was here at one point, and went through the same struggles.

The good programmers learned that there's always a solution, no matter how hopeless it seems. Practice googling the bugs you are getting. This could mean copy-pasting your error message, or trying to describe it to the search engine.

99.9% of the time, someone else has had the same problem, and there is a solution online. Especially for common beginner problems.
