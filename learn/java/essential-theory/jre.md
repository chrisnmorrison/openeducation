# What is JRE?

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package used for running Java applications. It is a collection of libraries and components that provide the runtime environment needed to execute Java programs. In this article, we'll take a closer look at what JRE is, what it includes, and how to download and install it.

## What is JRE?

JRE is a software package that provides the runtime environment needed to run Java applications. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is responsible for loading classes, allocating memory, and executing bytecode. JRE also includes other libraries and components needed to run Java code.

JRE is designed to be platform-independent, which means that it can run on any platform that supports Java. This makes it possible to run Java applications on any platform without any modifications.

## What does JRE include?

JRE includes several components that are used for running Java applications. Here are some of the most important components:

- Java Virtual Machine (JVM): The JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode. It is responsible for loading classes, allocating memory, and executing bytecode.
- Libraries: JRE includes several libraries that provide functionality for common programming tasks, such as networking, database access, and user interface development.
- Plugins: JRE includes browser plugins that allow Java applets to run in web browsers.

## How to download and install JRE?

:::danger
Did you install JDK in the previous lesson? If so, there's no need to install JRE.

**The JDK installation includes JRE**.

You should only install JRE without JDK if you want to run Java applications, but don't need the development kit. Since you're here to learn Java code, you need the JDK, so you only need to follow the JDK installation instructions on the previous page.
