# Theory Introduction

Yes, theory is boring. You probably just want to start learning how to code in Java, right?

We chose to include theory before code. Why? Learning the important non-code concepts behind a programming language will vastly enhance your learning. Additionally, even though different programming languages will have some theoretical overlap, they will have their own quirks and features. Mastering these quirks and features are essential to mastering the language.

Luckily, the number of weird quirks in Java is short. 

But, let's be honest. if you just want to learn how to write Java code, **you can skip this section** and jump right to the [Core Syntax](../fundamentals/introduction.md) section.

If you choose to do that, we hope that you will come back to this section later! Learning to code is only half the battle. Learning the theory behind code will:

- give you an incredible advantage in technical interviews (aka, you need to know this stuff if you want to work as a developer!)
- help you understand WHY your code works
- help you understand more general computing concepts, such as binary, hexadecimal, memory (and memory management), and so much more
- help you master language-specific knowledge, which will seperate you from those who don't understand programming theory
