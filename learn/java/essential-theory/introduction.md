# Java History

:::info
We'll start learning how to code in the [Java Syntax (Beginner)](../fundamentals/introduction) section of this course.

Java is a popular programming language that was first introduced in the mid-1990s by Sun Microsystems. Over the years, Java has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, with millions of developers using it to build everything from desktop applications to web-based services and mobile apps.

The origins of Java can be traced back to the early 1990s, when a group of Sun Microsystems engineers led by James Gosling began work on a new programming language that could develop software for consumer electronics devices such as set-top boxes and interactive televisions. At the time, there was a need for a programming language that was portable, efficient, and easy to use.

The team, which included Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, initially called the language "Oak." They later changed the name to "Java," which was inspired by a type of coffee that the team members were drinking at the time. The team wanted a name that was short, memorable, and catchy.

The first public release of Java was in 1995, and it quickly gained popularity among developers. One of the key features of Java was its "write once, run anywhere" capability, which meant that Java programs could run on any platform that had a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This was a major breakthrough, as it meant that developers no longer had to write separate code for each platform.

Another key feature of Java was its support for object-oriented programming (OOP), which was becoming increasingly popular at the time. OOP allows developers to create software using objects that have properties and methods, making it easier to write and maintain complex software systems.

Java also included several other features that made it popular with developers, including automatic memory management, support for multithreading, and a robust set of libraries and frameworks.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems released Java as an open-source language, making it available to developers around the world. This move helped to further increase Java's popularity, as it meant that developers could contribute to the language and build their own libraries and frameworks.

Over the years, Java has continued to evolve and improve. In 2004, Sun Microsystems released Java 5, which introduced several new features, including generics, annotations, and autoboxing. In 2011, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, and Java became one of its key products.

Today, millions of developers around the world use Java, and it is a key technology behind many of the world's most popular software systems. Java is used to build everything from desktop applications to mobile apps, web services, and enterprise systems.

Java has come a long way since its inception in the early 1990s. It has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language that is used by developers around the world to build software that runs on a wide range of platforms. With its rich set of features and ongoing support from the developer community, Java is likely to remain a popular programming language for years to come.
