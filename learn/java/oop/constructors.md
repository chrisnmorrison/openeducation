# Constructors

There are three types of constructors in Java:

    Default constructor: A constructor with no parameters is called the default constructor. If a class doesn't have a constructor, the compiler will automatically create a default constructor for the class.

    Parameterized constructor: A constructor with parameters is called a parameterized constructor. A parameterized constructor is used to pass values to the instance variables of the class when an object is created.

    Copy constructor: A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the same class as an argument and creates a new object with the same state as the object passed as an argument.

Note that in Java, constructors cannot be overridden, only overloaded. This means that you can have multiple constructors with different parameters in a single class, but you cannot define a new constructor with the same signature as an existing constructor in a subclass.
