# Introduction to OOP

Object Oriented Programming (commonly called OOP, which we'll often use) is a paradigm shift from other types of programming. It's more than just remembering code syntax. It's a way of thinking, and requires a complete change in how you write and structure code in order to fully grasp it.

But, don't be overwhelmed. OOP isn't learned in a day. It can take years to master OOP, and there are 1000+ page textbooks just on OOP.

Again, don't be overwhelmed! Take your time, and practice writing a lot of code. Once you understand it, you'll be happy that you do.

## What is OOP?

Many older programming languages are procedural programming languages, such as Fortran or COBOL. You code your instructions step-by-step and your program does something. There's nothing inherently wrong with this style of code, and it's still very popular today (e.g. writing scripts). But, imagine you have a program that consists of 5000 files, each with 2000 lines of code. Imagine how difficult it would be to track down errors, or remember how all your code interacts.

Object-oriented languages solve this problem, and add a ton of additional functionality. They allow you to group together different parts of your code, organize the parts, define information security, and so much more.

## Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

OOP has four main benefits / use-cases, which are sometimes called the _pillars of OOP_. Although none of them are actually necessary to write OOP code, using them brings significant advantages, and any expert OOP programmer will use them without question. In reality, they are essentially necessary to write organized, large applications.

It can be difficult to understand the 4 pillars without actually seeing code. Don't worry, we'll give plenty of examples as we go along. For now, aim for a high level understanding of these concepts.
