# Introduction to Collections

Data structures are quite simply what they sound like: **structured** ways to store **data**. Data structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing data in a computer program. They provide efficient ways to access and manipulate data, and can make programs more efficient and easier to read and maintain. There are many different types of data structures, each with their own advantages and disadvantages depending on the problem being solved. 

A Data Structure or Collection almost always refers to how data is stored in memory, rather than on a database or file for example. This means that you can pull the same data from a source, say a database, and use it in memory in many different ways depending on what you want to do. For example, you can store the same data in an `ArrayList` or a `Queue`, but how you work with it and access the data is very different.

Don't worry if this sounds a bit unclear. We'll provide plenty of examples in the upcoming lessons. 

Java Collections are a set of data structures provided by the Java programming language that can be used to store and manipulate collections of objects. They include both simple data structures like arrays and more complex structures like linked lists, maps, and sets. Collections provide a way to group and manage data in a program, and can be used to perform operations like sorting, searching, and filtering.

Java collections are implemented using interfaces and classes in the **Java Collections Framework**, which provides a standardized set of data structures and algorithms for working with collections. This makes it easy to use and manipulate collections in a consistent and efficient way across different programs and applications.
