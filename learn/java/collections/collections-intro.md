# Introduction to Collections

Data structures are quite simply what they sound like: **structured** ways to store **data**. Data structures are specialized formats for organizing and storing data in a computer program. They provide efficient ways to access and manipulate data, and can make programs more efficient and easier to read and maintain. There are many different types of data structures, each with their own advantages and disadvantages depending on the problem being solved.

A Data Structure or Collection usually refers to how data is stored in memory, rather than on a database or file for example. This means that you can pull the same data from a source, say a database, and use it in memory in many different ways depending on what you want to do. For example, you can store the same data in an `ArrayList` or a `Queue`, but how you work with it and access the data is very different.

Don't worry if this sounds a bit unclear. We'll provide plenty of examples in the upcoming lessons.

A collection is an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Java provides a comprehensive Collections Framework that allows developers to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

The **Java Collections Framework** is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. It contains a set of interfaces, implementations, and algorithms that provide a standard way of managing collections in Java. The framework is designed to be simple, efficient, and reusable.

The Collection interface is the foundation of the Java Collections Framework. It is the root interface of the collection hierarchy, which includes subinterfaces such as List, Set, and Queue. These subinterfaces represent different types of collections that can be used to store different types of data. For example, a List is an ordered collection of elements, while a Set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

The Java Collections Framework also includes concrete implementations of the Collection interface, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet. These implementations provide different ways of storing and accessing the data in a collection. For example, ArrayList is implemented as a resizable array, while LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list.

In addition to the Collection interface and its subinterfaces, the Java Collections Framework includes several utility classes and algorithms that can be used to manipulate collections. For example, the Collections class provides static methods for sorting, searching, and copying collections.

One of the key advantages of the Java Collections Framework is that it supports generics, which allow developers to specify the type of data that a collection can hold. This ensures that only the specified type of data is stored in the collection and helps to prevent type errors at runtime.
