# Open Ed

We're Open Ed, a free online learning platform.

What makes us different? By using our site, you can learn new skills while raising money for charity!

**As we are currently in beta development, we are currently not fundraising. We are primarily looking for contributors who share our vision: That learning should be free, and that **

## Why should I contribute?

Most websites are driven by profit, and even though our eventual goal is to generate revenue through advertising (and possibly, other non-intrusive means such as Buy me a Coffee or Ko-Fi), we are pledging to donate 90% of our proceeds to charity! [You can find out more on our website](https://opened.one/about). Rather than personal gain, we are driven by helping others. Users of our site will learn for free while generating money for charity. We've developed a new way of fundraising that doesn't require users to donate their own money.

Best of all, contributing is incredibly easy. The best way to contribute is to share knowledge, and most of our contributions don't require coding knowledge. Go ahead and add your contributions to your resume and portfolio, no matter how small. 

Let's work together to create something great.

## General info

We serve text-based courses for free, and we encourage our users to [contribute their own courses](./GUIDE_TO_CREATE_COURSES.md), or [add to our existing courses](./GUIDE_TO_UPDATE_COURSES.md). By contributing, you're contributing to an open-source project, and generating content that you may add to your resume.

## Technologies

Open Ed is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator. Before learning how to nagivate our project, we highly recommend you read [Docusaurus' documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

We write our pages using Markdown and React. It's not necessary that you know React to contribute, as the vast majority of our pages are Markdown only. But, our React pages are quite straightforward, so contributing to our React pages gives you a great opportunity to learn!

## How to contribute

We want Open Ed to be one of the easiest, beginner-friendly open source contributions that you can make.

Our beginner contributions:

- maintaining our documentation and guidelines
- creating and/or updating our courses

Our intermediate contributions:

- editing site layout
- improving SEO
- creating React components, and creating pages using React.
