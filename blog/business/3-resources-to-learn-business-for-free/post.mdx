Let's get down to business, and talk about business. Many businessmen and businesswomen follow a similar career path. University/College degree > MBA > Work. This is a common and effective path, but what about those who have a drive for business and innovation, but don't want to take on $100k+ in student debt?<!--truncate-->

We believe that everyone deserves to be part of today's innovative world driven by unique business strategies. Modern digital learning platforms fill this gap by offering free education that learners of all levels may take advantage of. Higher education has never been this accessible before, and with a growing catalog of free online courses, anyone can improve their desired skills for free.

There is so many other free resources online, on any topic you can dream of.

### 2. [Exercising Leadership: Foundational Principles](https://www.edx.org/course/exercising-leadership-foundational-principles) - EdX

Whatever your role as a business professional - employee, employer, manager, student, etc., everyone can benefit by leadership training. In addition to understanding your own strengths, weaknesses, and motivations, you should understand how successful leaders operate and inspire. There's a general "rule" we often see with many variations and interpretations: A good manager inspires their employees to work, rather than telling them to work. Essentially, a good leader is one that doesn't come off as a manager breathing down your neck. They should help you do your work, rather than authoritatively breathe down your neck.

Okay, enough about bad managers. It's easy to focus on the negatives in any situation, but learning and practicing the positives is much more rewarding. This foundational course on EdX teaches the, wait for it.. foundations of leadership. It's a short course compared to some other EdX courses, but it's still chock full of inspiring and meaningful advice. A great leader is someone with a vision, and the communication and drive to inspire others to help achieve that vision. This course provides important knowledge and background to make this happen.

### 3. [Business Strategy: Competitive Advantage](https://www.edx.org/course/business-strategy-from-wharton-competitive-advan-2) - EdX

Another fantastic course on EdX, which is also completely free unless you would like access to graded assignments/exams and a certificate of completion. This course targets those who have already completed business classes, or have experience in business, who would like to learn strategic planning. When there are fifty businesses offering a similar service, how does the customer choose who they offer their money to? A well-defined competitive business advantage helps customers make this choice, and drives the long-term growth of a business model.

Strategic planning may differ between different businesses (for example, a tech start-up vs a locally owned small business), but there are still many overlapping principles that drive tried-and-tested successes in the business world. Take advantage of these principles by completing this course on Business Strategy, and understanding how successful businesses create strategic possibilities and solve problems dynamically.
