Thank you for joining us on a journey for free education. Open Education is:

- A hub for knowledge. We are currently focused on tech, but we aim to expand into many more areas soon!
- Free forever. You don't pay a cent.
- A fundraiser. We are primarily monetized by non-invasive ad revenue, and we donate a portion of our proceeds to charity! Find more info [on our Donations page](/donations).
